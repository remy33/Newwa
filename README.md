# Newwa
A streaming and searching podcasts network.

There is nothing here yet.

### Note:

- Use port mapper to manually open the port

- Make sure you see the port open message ( otherwise you won't be able to download)!

- Make the K-bucket bigger to index dht faster.

## Motivation:
To create an open platform for people to share freely thier podcasts over the world.

They said it's not possible...

### ToDos :
- Anounce get, ask the peer itself for the torrent file ( )

### P.S. :
I was woundering if we should use strong typed events like [this](https://github.com/KeesCBakker/Strongly-Typed-Events-for-TypeScript) or should we stay vanilla for simpleness, I don't know the answer so we use vanilla.
